    "#### Sampling\n",

    "- what was the size of the sample (10, or 1000), small samples have errors\n",

    "- Sample - group of units drawn from a population\n",
    "- Sample size - number of units drawn and measured for that particular sample. The larger the sample the higher the accuracy of measurement\n",
    "- Central Limit Theorem - the more samples we take, the closer the mean of the 'sample means' will get us to the population (sample 1 mean is 5, sample 2 mean is 5.5, sample 3 mean is 4.5.... mean of means is 5 >> this must be very close to the population). And when you plot these different means for each sample it will look like a Normal Distribution. \n",
